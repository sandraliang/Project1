  <div class="lyrics1">
Three little birds sat on my window <br>
And they told me I don't need to worry <br>
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet <br>
Little girls, double-dutch on the concrete <br>
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right <br>
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same <br>
  <br><em>Ooo, don't you hesitate</em><br><br>
  </div>
  <div class="lyrics2">
Girl, <span>put your <span class="records">records</span> on</span>, tell me your favorite song<br>
You go ahead, let your hair down<br>
Sapphire and faded jeans<br>
I hope you get your dreams<br>
Just go ahead, let your hair down<br>
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow<br><br>
  </div>
  <div class="lyrics1">
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely<br>
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side<br>
(Just relax, just relax)<br>
Don't you let those other boys fool you<br>
Gotta love that Afro hairdo<br>
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right<br>
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change<br>
<br><br><em>Don't you think it's strange?</em><br><br>
</div>
<div class="lyrics2">
Girl, <span>put your <span class="records">records</span> on</span>, tell me your favorite song<br>
You go ahead, let your hair down<br>
Sapphire and faded jeans<br>
I hope you get your dreams<br>
Just go ahead, let your hair down<br>
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow<br>
</div>
<div class="lyrics3">
Just more than I could take<br>
Pity for pity's sake<br>
Some nights kept me awake<br>
I thought that I was stronger<br>
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?<br>
<br><br><em>Do what you want to</em><br><br>
</div>
<div class="lyrics2">
Girl, <span>put your <span class="records">records</span> on</span>, tell me your favorite song<br>
You go ahead, let your hair down<br>
Sapphire and faded jeans<br>
I hope you get your dreams<br>
Just go ahead, let your hair down<br>
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song<br>
You go ahead, let your hair down<br>
Sapphire and faded jeans<br>
I hope you get your dreams<br>
Just go ahead, let your hair down<br>
<br><br><em>Ooo, you're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow</em><br><br>
